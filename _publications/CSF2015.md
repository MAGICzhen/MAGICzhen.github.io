## Abstract
The effect of bounded noise on the chaotic behavior of a class of slowly varying oscillators is investigated. The stochastic Melnikov method is employed and then the criteria in both mean and mean-square sense are derived. The threshold amplitude of bounded noise given by stochastic Melnikov process is in good comparison with one determined by the numerical simulation of top Lyapunov exponents. The presence of noise scatters the chaotic domain in parameter space and the larger noise intensity results in a sparser and more irregular region. Both the simple cell mapping method and the generalized cell mapping method are applied to demonstrate the effects of noises on the attractors. Results show that the attractors are diffused and smeared by bounded noise and if the noise intensity increases, the diffusion is exacerbated.
