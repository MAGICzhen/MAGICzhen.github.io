# About Me
* I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/) at [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu), co-advised by Prof. [Ralf Haefner](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/haefner_ralf/index.html) and Prof. [Krishnan Padmanabhan](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/29791170-krishnan-padmanabhan).
* I received my first Ph.D. in General and Fundamental Mechanics at the [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://iao.nuaa.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Xianbin Liu](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/lxb/zh_CN/index.htm) and working in nonlinear stochastic dynamics and large deviation theory.
* My research interest lies in understanding the principles and mechanisms of computations performed by the mammalian brain at the level of both individual neurons and neuronal circuits. Specifically, I am interested in building neuronal circuit models and developing theoretical methods to analyze the activity of large populations of neurons and understand: 1. how patterns of neural activity are used to represent features of the sensory world, 2. how centrifugal feedback influences these patterns, 3. how these patterns generate motor behaviors, 4. at a higher level, how the neuronal circuits perform inference and represent uncertainty.
